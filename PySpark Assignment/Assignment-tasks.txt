Task to do :

# Download Sample Data:
	Download a sample dataset with multiple CSV files. For example, you can use the NASA Meteorite Landings dataset which contains multiple CSV files.

# Explore the Data:
	Examine the structure of the CSV files, understand the columns, data types, and any potential issues.

# Set up PySpark:
	Ensure that you have PySpark installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip install pyspark.

# Initialize PySpark Session:
	Create a PySpark session to work with Spark.

# Load CSV Files:
	Read all the CSV files into a PySpark DataFrame. Handle the case where the files might have different schemas.

# Data Cleaning and Transformation:
	Inspect and clean the data. Handle missing values, data type issues, and any inconsistencies.
Perform any necessary transformations based on the requirements (e.g., converting date strings to datetime objects).

# Create a Perfect Data Frame:
	Ensure that the data frame is well-structured, with appropriate column names, data types, and is ready for analysis.

# Create and Configure a Spark SQL Table:
	Use the DataFrame to create a temporary Spark SQL table for further querying. Configure the table properties like storage format, compression, etc.

# Perform Basic Queries:
	Run some basic Spark SQL queries on the table to verify that the data has been loaded successfully.

# Write the Final DataFrame to Parquet or Another Storage Format:
	Write the cleaned and transformed DataFrame into a more efficient storage format like Parquet.

# Documentation:
	Provide clear documentation in your script, commenting on each major step and explaining any decisions you made during data cleaning and transformation.

# Submission:
	Submit your Python script (.py file) along with any necessary instructions or documentation.

This assignment is designed to reinforce your understanding of PySpark, data cleaning, and transformation techniques, as well as working with large datasets. Good luck!
